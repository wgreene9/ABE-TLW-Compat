All that remains is a scarred and crumbling empire mired in despair. @FRC§YFrancia's§! territories have been divided time and again—whether by the @LOT§YHohenstaufen usurpers§! propped up by Otto or the @ARS§YArlesian rebels§! of Burgundy—each grinding the glory of the Carolingians into dust. From the failed expedition to Britain during the @NRMNorman Conquest§! to the crushing defeat against @ADUAndalusia§!, Francia's blood has nearly run dry. Lothair's chaotic rule has further emboldened the empire's vassals to scheme restlessly. The Crusader knights, retreating from Iberia, lick their wounds in @AVI§YAvignon§!. A storm gathers over Francia, as even the native nobles conspire in factions. A league of princes, calling themselves the @FRA§YSuccessors of France§!, begins to form. Will @FRC§YFrancia§! be torn apart by the storm? Or will it rise once more from the ruins, reclaiming the emperor's scepter? Or perhaps, return to the @FRU§Yold realm of the Father of Europe§!..."

Through patient endurance, hope finally dawned on the horizon—as reward for their loyalty, the Low Countries were granted autonomy. Yet the people of the Low Countries still lacked dignity and freedom equal to their struggles. Vile schemes and wicked ambitions ferment in the trembling goblets of arrogant high lords, and they shall soon taste the bitterness of regret. Only standing united can the people of the Low Countries reach for the stars.

Seizing the entire Eastern March would secure the family a true homeland. The unruly @BOH§YCzechs§! have never truly submitted within the Empire, but this very defiance makes them a formidable ally; further east, the @MGY§YMagyars§! have risen to prominence, and an olive branch might forge an unexpected diplomatic breakthrough.

He journeyed through many nations' lands, learning their strength and wisdom. With careful use of his companions' might, he carved a path to the future for the proud Greeks.

God save England - after crushing the Celts and reclaiming lands from the Vikings, this rising kingdom clearly possesses both the ambition and strength to dominate the world. Though not yet comparable to continental powers, none would deny England has become a regional hegemon, capable of intervening in affairs across Europe and beyond. Make the Franks bow, ending the long-standing stalemate; unite with Germanic brothers, marching shoulder to shoulder; dust off the tarnished laurels, wiping away the bitterness of past defeats; raise high the sacred cross, driving back the infidels; protect Jerusalem, then trample over the Muslims' holy sites... And when the Mediterranean resounds with hymns of triumph, perhaps distant oceans still hold vistas to captivate the soul. The day may come when the world is @ENG@GBR§YEngland's§! accordion, rising and falling in harmony with her will."

string_start_TIR: "When §YWerner III von Habsburg§! had a Styrian duke's spear pointed at his head, the duke saw only a trapped beast - the weak and muddied Count of Innsbruck - forgetting they were once eagles soaring freely over the Alps' peaks. Wealth, power, land - the Electors of Styria rose from Otto's dynastic corpse, yet their own ambition and greed would dig their graves. From the mountains of Aargau, the House of Habsburg was destined to become the Babenbergs' pallbearers. Styria's status, gained by gnawing Otto's bones and betraying Swabian lords, could never last.\nAfter the Carolingians reclaimed Otto's crown, the Duke of Styria curried imperial favor, swallowing chunks of South Germany and Carniola. But Swabia's Hohenstaufens would never tolerate this traitor devouring their influence. Thus in the 12th century, when Habsburg rebels from Switzerland rose in Tyrol against Babenberg rule, Swabian-Lombard armies stood behind them. The Styrian duke's dream of crushing Tyrol ended in bitter betrayal - Bavaria and Carniola declared independence. Yet when the childless Lombard king died, the war ended. The Habsburgs ascending Tyrol's throne joined Bavaria in swearing fealty to Swabia's Frederick Barbarossa. Under him, Swabia amassed wealth and lands - the Hohenstaufen Iron Century seemed reborn.\nBut when Barbarossa's soul ascended during his crusade, restless eagles scented freedom again. Tyrol and Bavaria renounced the new Hohenstaufen monarch, reclaiming independence. Yet peace was fragile - Swabia's old lords wouldn't accept defeat, Styria's Babenbergs nursed grudges, and Italy's southern chaos bred endless war. The Habsburgs tread carefully, seeking Carolingian and other patrons to balance these forces.\nYet Habsburg rulers never forgot their dynasty's destiny. Imperial eagles weren't meant to forever cower in Tyrolean valleys. God's anointed Lord of Tyrol would claim his birthright - duty, glory, and the Habsburg iron eagle soaring over Empire. They were fated to rule the world. The crown of justice, the blade of honor, the Father-blessed eagle would dominate the skies. Whom God elects, He loves; whom He unjustly favors, He makes to fear!"
